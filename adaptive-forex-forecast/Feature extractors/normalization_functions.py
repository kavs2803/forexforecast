    Simplest normalization function

    This function takes in a list, finds the maximum element in the list and divides all the elements of the list by
    maximum element, and returns the list with maximum element appended to the end of list. As a result, the data is
    normalized between 0 and 1.

    :param data: (list) containing features to be normalized
    :return: (list) normalized features + maximum value
    '''
    max_elem = max(data)
    normalized_data = [i / max_elem for i in data]
    normalized_data.append(max_elem)
    return normalized_data
