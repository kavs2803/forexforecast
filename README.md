Adaptive Forex Forecast
This project provides a machine learning-based approach to forecast foreign exchange rates. It leverages adaptive models and algorithms to analyze and predict future currency trends based on historical data.

Features
Forex Data Analysis: Extract and preprocess historical exchange rate data.
Adaptive Forecasting Models: Uses advanced algorithms (e.g., Least Mean Squares, regression) to predict future forex rates.
Visualization: Graphical representation of predicted vs. actual values for better interpretation.
Modular Code: Easy to modify and adapt for new datasets and forecasting techniques.
